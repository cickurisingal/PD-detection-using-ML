The project uses ML algorithms to detect voice variations in patients with and without Parkinson's disease. Data preprocessing and feature engineering are done to select the relevant features. Different machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines will be trained on the selected features to develop a robust and accurate model for Parkinson's disease detection. The developed model is evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and reliability in detecting Parkinson's disease. The model is trained to accept and predict new data values. The model is optimized to improve its performance and reduce the risk of overfitting.
